# Using Machine Learning to Unlock Insights with Customer Segmentation: A Deep Dive into E-commerce Revenue Analysis

In the world of data analytics, customer segmentation can often feel like equipping a sales team with a powerful map, guiding them to where the gold is buried. It's a necessary process that turns raw data into actionable insights. Recently, I ran a segmentation analysis using a public dataset to reveal patterns that could drastically improve how businesses approach their customers and boost revenue.

In this blog post, I’ll walk you through the step-by-step process I used to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. We’ll also dive into the conclusions I reached, revealing an interesting contrast between two distinct customer segments. You can find all the code for this project on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Gmuman7), and the dataset I used is publicly available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data).

## The Problem: How Do We Understand Our Customers?
Customer segmentation is like tuning an engine. It allows us to group customers into segments that exhibit similar behaviors, so we can understand how different groups are contributing to the business. When done correctly, it shows us not only where to focus our resources but also who our most valuable customers are.

For this project, I worked with an e-commerce dataset that recorded transactions and customer purchases. My goal was to segment the customers into groups based on key metrics: total revenue, frequency of purchases, and average order value (AOV).

## The Process: Breaking Down the Data and Applying Clustering
To segment the customers, I followed a systematic process that involved a few key steps:

### 1. Preprocessing the Data
The first step was cleaning and organizing the dataset. I calculated three critical metrics for each customer:

- **Total Revenue**: The total amount a customer spent on purchases.
- **Frequency**: How many times the customer made a purchase.
- **Average Order Value (AOV)**: The average value of each order.

These metrics helped provide a detailed picture of each customer’s buying behavior.

### 2. K-means Clustering
Next, I applied the K-means clustering algorithm to group customers based on their purchasing behavior. K-means works like an experienced cartographer. It draws boundaries between different clusters, making it easier to understand which groups of customers share similar traits.

I ran the K-means algorithm and, using the elbow method, found that segmenting the customers into two distinct clusters provided the most meaningful insights.

We then ran the algorithm with only 2 clusters and exported the results to a `.csv` file for analysis.

### 3. Visualizing the Segments
To understand how these clusters differed, I used a heatmap to compare metrics like total revenue, frequency, and AOV across the two groups. Visualizing the clusters this way is like flipping on the high beams—suddenly, the patterns become crystal clear.

## Key Insights: The Power of Frequent Buyers
The segmentation revealed two very different customer segments, and here’s where things got really interesting:

### Cluster 1: The Frequent Buyers  
This cluster turned out to be a small but powerful group of customers, contributing a significant portion of the revenue:

- **Total Revenue**: $100,000
- **Median Frequency**: 1971 purchases
- **Average Order Value (AOV)**: $55.38

These frequent buyers were like the engine of the e-commerce platform. Despite being fewer in number, they were responsible for a large chunk of the business's revenue. Their high purchasing frequency suggests that they have a strong relationship with the platform, making frequent and consistent purchases.

### Cluster 2: The Casual Shoppers  
On the other side, we had a larger cluster of casual shoppers:

- **Total Revenue**: $645.81
- **Median Frequency**: 41.5 purchases
- **Average Order Value (AOV)**: $16.90

This group, while making up a larger portion of the customer base, contributed significantly less to the platform's overall revenue. Their behavior is more typical of casual, infrequent buyers who may come for specific needs but don’t make it a habit to return often.

## What Does This Mean for Businesses?
The findings from this segmentation are like having two different drivers for your sales car: one that steadily keeps the wheels turning and another that only appears for quick, small trips. The frequent buyers are clearly more valuable, providing consistent revenue streams, while the casual shoppers might represent opportunities for growth or better engagement.

### Actionable Insights:
- **Retention Efforts**: For the frequent buyers, it’s important to focus on retention strategies, such as loyalty programs, personalized promotions, or exclusive offers to keep them engaged.
- **Upselling Opportunities**: For the casual shoppers, there’s potential to increase their average order value or frequency by introducing upselling or cross-selling strategies. They may need a nudge to move from occasional purchases to more consistent buying behavior.

## Conclusion
Customer segmentation helps businesses see which groups of customers are their most valuable, and which ones might need more attention. The results from this project revealed a small but powerful cluster of frequent buyers who contribute a significant portion of revenue, alongside a larger group of casual shoppers who provide less consistent returns. Both groups have their own importance, but they need to be approached with different strategies.

You can check out the code used for this project on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Gmuman7), and feel free to experiment with the data yourself by using the publicly available [ecommerce dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data).

In today’s data-driven world, it’s not enough to just collect data—you need to operationalize it in ways that drive revenue and build stronger customer relationships. With the right tools and insights, businesses can turn a simple dataset into a roadmap for success.
